# ScalaPages #

A page object DSL for [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and [Selenium](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_selenium).

Page specific logic is encapsulated in page specific classes. Actions to be performed on a page are scoped to blocks.

```scala
  "After searching, the results page" should "have the correct title" in {
    go to home and { > =>
      > search "Cheese!"
    } lastly { > =>
      > check title
    }
  } 
```
